# Service Exploitation

Service exploitation in the context of Active Directory security involves the exploitation of various services such as SMB (Server Message Block), WinRM (Windows Remote Management), LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), and others, typically to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges within a network. Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in these services to execute remote code, conduct reconnaissance, or perform lateral movement within the network. For example, exploiting SMB vulnerabilities like EternalBlue could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely and propagate across machines. Similarly, abusing misconfigured WinRM endpoints could provide attackers with remote administrative access to compromised systems.
